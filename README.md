## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

As part of our commitment to security and transparency, this project includes a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in the associated NuGet packages. The SBOM provides a detailed inventory of the components and dependencies included in the package, allowing you to track and verify the software components, their licenses, and versions.

**Why SBOM?**

- **Improved Transparency**: Gain insight into the open-source and third-party components included in this package.
- **Security Assurance**: By providing an SBOM, we enable users to more easily track vulnerabilities associated with the included components.
- **Compliance**: SBOMs help ensure compliance with licensing requirements and make it easier to audit the project's dependencies.

You can find the SBOM in the NuGet package itself, which is automatically generated and embedded during the build process.
